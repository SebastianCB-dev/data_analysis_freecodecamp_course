### Data Analysis with Python

Data Analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and making decisions.

##### Tools for Data Analysis
There are two categories of tools for data analysis:
1. **Auto-managed closed tools**: For example, Qlik, Tableau, and Power BI.
2. **Programming Languages**: For example, Python, R, and Julia.

**Advantages and disadvantages of each category**

- Advantages:
For the first category, the tools are closed source, expensive, limited.
For the second category, the tools are extremely powerful and steep learning curve.
- Disadvantages:
For the first category, the tools are easy to learn.
For the second category, the tools are Open Source, Free or very cheap.

#### Why Python for Data Analysis?
Why would we choose Python over R or Julia?

- Very simple and intuitive to learn
- "correct" language
- Powerful libraries (not just for data analysis)
- free and open source
- amazing community, docs and conferences

#### When to choose R?
Python, sadly, is not always the answer.

- When R Studio is needed
- When dealing with advanced statistical methods
- When extreme performance is needed

### Data Analysis Process
1. **Data Collection**: Data is collected from a source. (e.g. scrapping, file formats, sql, API). Where is your data coming from?
2. **Data Cleaning**: Data is cleaned by removing or replacing missing or invalid data.
3. **Data Wrangling**: Data is wrangled by combining multiple data sources.
4. **Data Analysis**: Data is analyzed by using statistical methods.
5. **Action**: We can do whatever we want with the data. (e.g. visualization, machine learning, data mining, etc.)


#### Differences between Data Analysis and Data Science

Data Analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and making decisions.

On the other hand Data Science is a process of analyzing data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and making decisions.

#### Python Ecosystem:
Libraries:
- pandas: DataFrame, Series, DataFrame methods, etc.
- numpy: arrays, math, etc.
- matplotlib: plotting
- scipy: scientific computing
- sklearn: machine learning
- seaborn: statistical visualization
- statsmodels: statistical analysis
